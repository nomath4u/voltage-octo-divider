This is a sketch that takes voltage in from my powersupply and then outputs that voltage to a seven segment display. The powersupply at maximum puts out 15V and because the arduino can only take 5V max I am using a resistive voltage divider in the powersupply to step it down. However this means that the output from the arduino will need to be multiplied back by the voltage divider.
